            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>The year is 2024. For better or worse, the popularity and accessibility of large language model contraptions like ChatGPT have made it easy for STEM newbies (like me) to create websites (like this) with relatively few headaches. (Still some, though.)</p>
	    <p>With a degree in applied mathematics under my belt (coming Spring 2025!) and a smattering of foundational courses in genetics, organic chemistry, data structures and algorithms, and others, this site is my attempt to digitize and organize my thoughts and goals as I explore what piques my interest in this brave new world. Hopefully it might also show some big dogs somewhere that I might actually be able to meaningful work related to these interests someday.</p>
